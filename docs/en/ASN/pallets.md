#### 2.2.3.2.4 Create a new pallet 

- Option to add a new pallet to the system. 

- Clicking on this option opens a form in which the user can enter the data necessary to register 
a new pallet: 

   - Pallet name: Unique pallet ID that allows easy recognition in the system. For example: "Pallet 
   1", "Food Pallet", "Pallet Zone A". Facilitates the organization and tracking of pallets within 
   inventory and logistics. 

   - Height: The vertical measurement of the pallet, from its base to the top. Units: Specified in the 
   configured system, such as centimeters, inches, or meters. Example: 15 cm, 6 inches. Helps 
   calculate the space required for storage and transportation, especially when pallets are 
   stacked. 

   - Width: The horizontal measurement of the pallet at its shortest side. Units: Specified in cm, 
   inches, meters, etc. Example: 80 cm, 32 inches. This is critical to ensure the pallet fits properly 
   in storage racks or transport spaces. 

   - Length: The horizontal measurement of the pallet from front to back. It is measured in the 
   same units as the width and height. Example: 40 cm, 16 inches. Together with the width and 
   height, it determines the volume and space required for storage. 

   - Size Units: Specifies the measurement system used for pallet dimensions. Example: Centi
   meters (cm), inches (in), meters (m). Unifies measurements and prevents errors when mixing 
   different unit systems. 

   - Gross Weight: The total weight of the pallet, including its contents, packaging, and any additional materials. Units: Kilograms (kg), pounds (lb), etc. Example: 12 kg, 26 lb. This is critical for calculating transportation costs and complying with maximum weight regulations. 

   - Net weight: The weight of the pallet's contents, not including packaging. Units: Same unit as 
   gross weight (kg, lb, etc.). Example: 10 kg, 22 lb. Useful for determining the value of the con
   tents, especially in trade and inventories. 

   - Weight units: A system of measurement for weight (kilograms, pounds, etc.). Example: kg, lb. Ensures consistency in measurements and prevents errors in interpretation, especially in in
   ternational contexts. 

The form includes validations to ensure data integrity before saving. Together, these 
fields ensure that pallets can be properly identified, measured, weighed and trans
ported. They facilitate logistics, warehousing, inventory and trade by providing all 
the key information about the physical characteristics of each pallet. 

<b>The pallet needs to be created here so that it is recorded in the system and 
can be made available later in the packaging section, ensuring that the correct 
specifications are used in subsequent processes.</b>
